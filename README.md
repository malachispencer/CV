## Malachi Spencer

Lancaster University philosophy graduate, former sales executive and former fitness/bodybuilding [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/hypertrophyofficial), I am now looking to make the transition into the world of tech. In January 2020, I started learning Ruby and the fundamentals of programming, by March, I had officially developed an addiction to coding - the [400+ kata](https://www.codewars.com/users/mjsspencer) I've completed on Codewars can attest to that. In June 2020, I started learning JavaScript and in September I created 2 web apps, [Skynet Chat](https://github.com/malachispencer/skynet-chat) and [SkyRooms](https://skyrooms-ms.herokuapp.com). In October, I enrolled at Makers Academy, where I built on my self-taught skills, grounding myself in best practices such as object-oriented programming, test driven development, agile processes and more. Now, having recently graduated Makers, I am looking to land a role as a junior developer.

## Skills

#### Problem solver

In order to undertake a degree in philosophy, one must possess an analytical mind and a natural inquisitiveness. These traits, along with the logical thinking skills developed during my degree and the obsessive focus I put into any activity I commit to, have moulded me into a competent problem solver. From March 2020 to September 2020 I completed over 400 kata on Codewars, in my [Codewars repository](https://github.com/malachispencer/codewars) you can view my 'write ups'. A write up includes my solution, one or two solutions from other Codewars users and detailed explanations for all of those solutions.

#### Teamwork

Much of my time at Makers involved building applications in teams. As a result, I have gained a great deal of exposure to agile processes such as building features in sprints, daily standups, sprint retrospectives, working to user stories, continuous integration and more. Not only was it important to foster these good team practices, often time it had to be done while also learning new technologies, whether it was learning Rails during my second engineering project, or learning Flutter and Dart for my [final project](https://github.com/AdamusBG/laetus).

#### Self starter

Comfortable working in a team, I am also adept at working on my own intitiative. Whether it was sourcing my own students as a private tutor or starting my own YouTube channel, the evidence of this is clear. Before even joining Makers - a bootcamp which strongly emphasises the importance of self-directed learning - I taught myself how to code, managing my own time and structuring my own learning, successfully. My enthusiasm, passion and dilligence will ensure that I won't require hand holding in any role.

#### Excellent communicator

Studying philosophy has bestowed me with the ability to take complex ideas and explain them in a concise, easy to understand manner, this goes for both written and verbal communication. In order to have a YouTube channel, solid communication is a must, you can see a short, one minute example of my verbal communication [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFkbAElCcUw&ab_channel=Hypertrophy). Additionally, I am a member of Toastmasters' London Business School Speaking club and prior to COVID-19 disruptions attended meetings weekly, taking on roles and speaking consistently.
