## Malachi Spencer

Lancaster University philosophy graduate, former sales executive and former fitness/bodybuilding [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/hypertrophyofficial), I am now looking to make the transition into the world of tech. In January 2020, I started learning Ruby and the fundamentals of programming, by March, I had officially developed an addiction to coding - the [400+ kata](https://www.codewars.com/users/mjsspencer) I've completed on Codewars can attest to that. In June 2020, I started learning JavaScript and in September I created 2 web apps, [Skynet Chat](https://skynet-chat.herokuapp.com) and [SkyRooms](https://skyrooms-ms.herokuapp.com). In October, I enrolled at Makers Academy, where I built on my self-taught skills, grounding myself in best practices such as object-oriented programming, test driven development and agile processes. Now, having recently graduated Makers, I am looking to land a role as a junior developer.

## Skills

#### Problem solver

In order to undertake a degree in philosophy, one must possess an analytical mind and a natural inquisitiveness. These traits, along with the logical thinking skills developed during my degree and the obsessive focus I put into any activity I commit to, have moulded me into a competent problem solver. From March 2020 to September 2020 I completed over 400 kata on Codewars, in my [Codewars repository](https://github.com/malachispencer/codewars) you can view my 'write ups'. A write up includes my solution, one or two solutions from other Codewars users and detailed explanations for all of those solutions. Crucially, this dexerity in problem solving was integral in surmounting a major sticking point the group faced during my Makers final project, namely, implementing the main feature, the pixel colour detection feature.

#### Teamwork

Much of my time at Makers involved building applications in teams. As a result, I have gained a great deal of exposure to agile processes such as building features in sprints, daily standups, sprint retrospectives, working to user stories, continuous integration and more. Whatever team I work in, I pride myself on being an asset to that team and hence I am willing to go the extra mile to do so. During my second Makers engineering project, we were stuck on implementing comments on posts - using AJAX - in Rails, a framework we were working with for the very first time. After we finished for the day, I worked until midnight to figure it out and built the feature on a mock project, the next morning - with the approval of the team - I integrated the feature into our application, allowing us to move on to new tickets faster than we otherwise would have.

#### Communication

I am an active listener that takes in information from my environment and this proved valuable when producing content on YouTube, as it allowed me to be empathetic to my viewers of how they would view my content. It was also integral when communicating in a pressurised environment during my Makers final project, allowing me to understand the perspectives of my teammates and hence we could coordinate our knowledge sharing and task delegation more effectively. On the speaking side, studying philosophy has bestowed me with the ability to take complex ideas and explain them in a concise, easy to understand manner, this goes for both written and verbal communication and was important when teaching my students as a private tutor. Always seeking self-improvement, I am a member of Toastmaster's London Business School Speaking Club and prior to COVID-19 disruptions attended meetings weekly, taking on roles and speaking consistently.

#### Self starter

Comfortable working in a team, I am also adept at working on my own intitiative. Whether it was sourcing my own students as a private tutor or starting my own YouTube channel, the evidence of this is clear. Before even joining Makers - a bootcamp which strongly emphasises the importance of self-directed learning - I taught myself how to code, managing my own time and structuring my own learning, successfully. My enthusiasm, passion and dilligence will ensure that I won't require hand holding in any role.
