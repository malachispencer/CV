## Malachi Spencer

Lancaster University philosophy graduate, former sales executive and former fitness/bodybuilding [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/hypertrophyofficial), I am now looking to make the transition into the world of tech. In January 2020, I started learning Ruby and the fundamentals of programming, by March, I had officially developed an addiction to coding - the [400+ kata](https://www.codewars.com/users/mjsspencer) I've completed on Codewars can attest to that. In June 2020, I started learning JavaScript and by September I had created 2 apps, [Skynet Chat](https://github.com/malachispencer/skynet-chat) and [SkyRooms](https://github.com/malachispencer/skyrooms). Now - at Makers Academy - I'm looking to build on the self-taught skills I've acquired and land a role as a full stack junior developer.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### Problem solver

In order to undertake a degree in philosophy, one must possess an analytical mind and a natural inquisitiveness. These factors, along with the logical thinking skills developed during my degree and the obsessive focus I put into any activity I commit to, have moulded me into a competent problem solver. From March 2020 to September 2020 I completed over 400 kata on Codewars, in my [Codewars repository](https://github.com/malachispencer/codewars) you can view my 'write ups'. A write up includes my solution, one or two solutions from other Codewars users and detailed explanations for all of those solutions.

#### Excellent communicator

Studying philosophy has also bestowed me with the ability to take complex ideas and explain them in a concise, easy to understand manner, this goes for both written and verbal communication. In order to have a YouTube channel, solid communication is a must, you can see a short, one minute example of my verbal communication [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFkbAElCcUw&ab_channel=Hypertrophy). Additionally, I am a member of Toastmasters' London Business School Speaking club and prior to COVID-19 disruptions attended meetings weekly, taking on roles and speaking consistently.

#### Strong work ethic

Motivated and ambitious, I have never shied away from endeavours which require hard work and dedication. In my time bodybuilding, I trained 5-6 times per day, consumed 4000-5000 calories per day and never strayed from the program. Work ethic is important to me and discipline is deeply ingrained in me. In my time teaching myself to code, it was not uncommon for me to spend 10-12 hours a day coding. Most importantly, I enjoyed it.

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
